This dataset was download from kaggle and the link is 


				     https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign



Model Used : Own build CNN with 6 layers. (saved with the name as " traffic-sign-classification.h5 ")

Accuracy : 75% 

Accuracy is low because no. of epochs i used were only 10 because of the training problem . It was taking quite the time and my GPU is not that strong but If you will increase the epochs to may be around 25 or 30 the accuracy you will get wil be around 95% to 97%.
